All algorithms were made for a course on my studies. They are not optimalized.

Package Queues:
	Implementation of:
		1. FIFO implemented on one way linked list with head.
		2. FIFO implemented on an array.
		3. Ringbuffer implemeneted on an array.
Package Stacks:
	Implementation of:
		1. Stack based on an one way linked list with head.
		2. Stack based on a dynamic array (filling 80% of an array makes it bigger 2 times/filling 20% of an array makes it smaller 2 times)
			*Projecting to an integer number, so e.g. 5/2 = 2.
		3. Searching binary form for a natural number based on a stack.
		4.Calculating expression written as Postfix Notation expression.
			* Expression is read from a file called "file.txt" which is stored inside a program (not specified path).

Package SimpleSorting:
	3 tasks:
		A - single key for every attribute
		B - all keys (advanced method)
		C - compound comparator
	Implementation of:
		1. Insert sort algorithm
Package BSTree:
	Implementation of Binary Searth Tree with methods listed below:
		1. Insert node

		6. Min key
		7. Max key
		8. Depth
		9. Amount of nodes
		10. Amount of leaves
		11. Nodes in levels
		12. Successor
		13. Predecessor
		14. Delete node
	*15th option in console menu is not implemented yet.


Package RBTree:
	Implementation of Red-Black Tree with methods listed below:
		1. Insert node
		2. Show tree in Preorder
		3. Show tree in Inorder
		4. Show tree in Postorder
		5. Check if tree contains specific key
		6. Max Depth
		7. Max of left/right subtree
		8. Amount of nodes
		9. Amount of nodes for right/left subtree
		10. Add parameters to node

Package ForestsAndCounts:
	Implementation of:
		1. Forest Separable Collection implemented on a list without compression.
		2. Forest Separable Collection implemented on a list with balancing.
		3. Forest Separable Collection implemented on an array without compression.
		4. Matrix.
		5. Directed Matrix.
		6. Array list count.
